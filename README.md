# ICS4U_Final

## Project Description and Purpose:
My project is the Historical Weather Network website which uses 150 years of weather data from a station in Toronto, Ontario.
It allows the user to do a number of data related tasks, such as finding daily or monthly averages for a type of weather.

## Goal of the Project:
The goal of this project was to help me familiarize myself with Python data management and the tools that are involved, particularly Pandas and Matplotlib.
By the due date, I accomplished my learning objective and was able to make an interesting website with the data I found.

## Technology Used:
I used Streamlit to build the user interface webpage that presents the data and functions in a much more visually appealing way. For the data
manipulation itself I used Pandas as well as my own custom functions. The graphs were made using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The entire project is built using Python.
